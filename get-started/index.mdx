## Welcome to Costory

SREs and DevOps got a new "side job": **explaining and justifying cloud costs**.

It's repetitive, manual, and usually nobody's priority — but it still burns **half a day to a full week every month**.

Costory automates those FinOps chores.

We built a virtual FinOps assistant (called **Billy** in the UI) that:

- Monitors cloud spend across providers
- Explains changes with technical and business context
- Correlates spikes with deployments, usage, and provider events
- Prepares reports you can share with engineering and leadership

You keep focusing on uptime, performance, and shipping.

**Billy** keeps an eye on the bill.

## What you'll find in these docs

- **Get started** → How to get useful cost insights in your **first week**.

    What Costory ingests, how it differs from your CSP console, and how to connect your first billing export and receive your first **Digest**.

- **Set up your project** → How to connect billing logs (GCP/AWS/Azure), usage data (Datadog, BigQuery…), and engineering events (GitHub, CI/CD).

    This gives Costory the context it needs to *explain* anomalies rather than just raise alerts.

- **Set up automation** → How to let Costory take over recurring FinOps tasks:

    monthly reporting, investigations, and leadership updates — automated.
