## Step 1 → Connect your first billing log

Pick your cloud provider, plug in the billing export, and Costory starts ingesting raw line items.

### GCP → BigQuery Billing Export

You provide:

- Billing export **table path**
- View-only IAM access

You need:

- An active **Detailed Billing Export** in BigQuery
- **GKE cost allocation** enabled (if running GKE)

### AWS → CUR 2.0

You provide:

- Federated Role ARN
- S3 bucket name
- CUR 2.0 name

Supported setup paths:

- **CloudFormation template**
- **Manual setup**

Notes:

- CUR 2.0 in **Parquet format** recommended
- CUR does **not** need to live in the master payer account
- Optional: **EKS / ECS allocation tags** for granular attribution

### Azure → Cost Management Exports

You provide:

- SAS Token
- Blob SAS URL
- Container name
- Storage account name

After granting access, trigger a **backfill** from the Azure Cost Management export panel.

## Step 2 → Receive your first Digest (your last-month summary)

~24 hours after your first import, Costory generates your **Digest** summarizing the last complete month.

You get:

- What changed
- A tree-structured breakdown of your infra
- Automated analysis via **Billy** (time series, outlier detection, RCA hints)
- A summary ready for Slack or review docs

**It's the monthly review you already do — now automated.**

## Step 3 → Build Scheduled Slack Reports

Turn any Saved View into a recurring Slack report.

- Weekly or monthly
- Delivered to channels like `#platform`, `#sre`, `#leadership`
- Includes: summary, deltas, investigation links

You stop being the human router for "what happened on the bill?"

Each squad gets *their* cost visibility and learns to own it.
