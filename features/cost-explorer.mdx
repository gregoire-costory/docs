A real explorer — not another billing dashboard.

- Multi-cloud normalized (**AWS, GCP, Azure, Datadog, Confluent…**)
- Billing enriched with **usage, deployments, incidents, events**
- Breakdowns across service, project, namespace, cluster, env, team
- Designed for fast engineering investigations

Explorer answers:

- "Why did costs spike yesterday?"
- "Who owns this increase?"
- "What's our biggest driver this month?"
- "Is cost-per-transaction degrading?"

## Key capabilities

- **Interactive charts** (team, env, provider, service)
- **Smart drill-downs** (total spend → resource)
- **Event overlays** (deploys, incidents, provider events)
- **Cost formulas** (cost-per-user, cost-per-request, etc.)

## Common workflows

- Spike investigation → service → project → events
- Biggest driver → drill → share with owners
- Team cost → Virtual Dimensions → Slack channel
- Efficiency → formula → trend → threshold alerts
