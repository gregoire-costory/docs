**Turn thousands of billing lines into a short, prioritized list of what actually matters.**

Cloud bills are noisy: thousands of deltas, no sense of weight or priority.

Digest fixes that by:

- Aggregating changes across service, project, env, team
- Prioritizing based on **absolute dollar impact**
- Surfacing real drivers of change
- Highlighting investigation candidates — without juggling 5 tools

## Why this matters

- A 300% jump on $10 is noise
- A 5% bump on $200K is serious

Digest lets you:

- Spend minutes, not hours, on reviews
- Avoid missing major issues hidden in hundreds of tiny changes
- Immediately tell whether a spike was intentional or accidental

## Using Digest for cost overview

Digest gives you:

- Top cost drivers
- What changed and why
- Which teams/services own the change
- A drill path: *total → service → project → resource*

Structured triage instead of manual hunting.
