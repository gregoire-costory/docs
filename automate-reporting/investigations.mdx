When something spikes, Costory gives you a **route**, not just an alert.

Digest and Smart Alerts (beta) pinpoint:

- What moved
- When it moved
- Which services/projects/namespaces/teams moved
- Which events correlate

Powered by Explorer:

- Multi-cloud normalized billing
- Usage overlays
- Virtual Dimensions
- Cost formulas
- Event correlation

## Typical investigation workflow

1. Open the spike
2. Narrow to 24h/7d
3. Group by service → drill
4. Group by project/env/team → drill
5. Check events (deploys, incidents, price changes)
6. Overlay usage or formulas to see if it's volume or efficiency

## Outcome

From "Who changed what?"

To "This service doubled pods after deploy; traffic is flat; check autoscaling."
