Different roles need different views.

Costory adapts automatically:

## Engineering

- Per-team & per-service cost
- Deployments, incidents, scaling events
- Efficiency metrics, cost-per-unit

## Finance

- Total spend
- Trends
- Commitments & risks
- Infra as % of revenue

## CTO / VP Eng

- Cost by product line
- Cost by team
- Cost tied to roadmap and incidents
- Efficiency trends & anomalies

Your dashboard becomes a **single pane of glass** for everyone.

## How Slack reports help leadership

- CFO → monthly summary in `#leadership`
- CTO → weekly product/team breakdown in `#platform`
- Squads → team-specific cost views in their channels

Always consistent. Always up to date.

No more screenshots, one-off exports, or explaining the same thing twice.
