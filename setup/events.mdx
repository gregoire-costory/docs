Cost spikes always map to events.

Costory ingests:

- GitHub deploys
- CI/CD pipeline events
- Custom events
- Provider events (AWS live; Azure/GCP coming)

## Provider events include

- RI / SP purchases & expirations
- Marketplace renewals
- Capacity changes
- SKU price changes

## Why this matters

Useful for:

- "Why did cost jump on the 1st?"
- "Why is on-demand spend higher with flat traffic?"
- "Why is this service suddenly more expensive?"
