Spend alone doesn't explain anything.

Costory ingests:

- Datadog metrics
- Warehouse metrics
- Custom business metrics

Used for:

- Explaining cost changes
- Tracking cost-per-unit
- Separating load vs inefficiency

## Normalize with formulas

Examples:

- `cost / monthly_active_users`
- `cost / (api_requests / 1_000_000)`
- `(cost / revenue) * 100`
- `cost / storage_gb`

Lets you say things like:

- "Cost per transaction +15%"
- "Cost per API call improved after optimization"
